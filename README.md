# networkmapping

networkmapping.py: This script creates a consensus InfoMap solution to identify whole brain functional networks. It combines InfoMaps ran on cortical resting state fMRI 
data, at multiple sparsity thresholds, in a semi-intelligent way. It then matches the consensus communities to the nearest match on a given template network map.
