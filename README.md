# networkmapping

networkmapping.py: This script creates a consensus InfoMap solution to identify whole brain functional networks. It combines InfoMaps ran on cortical resting state fMRI data, at multiple sparsity thresholds. It then matches the consensus communities to the nearest match on a given template network map.
